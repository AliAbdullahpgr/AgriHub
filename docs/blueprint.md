## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep desaturated blue (#3B5998) to evoke feelings of trust, reliability, and stability. This is intended to convey confidence in the displayed information.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF). This ensures readability and provides a calm, neutral backdrop that keeps attention focused on the content.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#8A2BE2) to draw attention to interactive elements or key data points on the dashboard. It adds a modern touch and contrasts with the primary blue, creating a balanced, professional interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that maintains a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, making it an excellent choice for both headlines and body text.
- Employ a grid-based layout for the dashboards to ensure consistent alignment and spacing.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent different data types and categories. This will provide visual cues and aid in navigation.
- Subtle transitions and animations (e.g., loading spinners, progress bars) to provide feedback to the user and enhance the overall experience.
